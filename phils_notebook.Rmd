This is my import procedure (yes, it is great, isn't it)

```{r}
library(haven)
cars <- read_sas("http://www.principlesofeconometrics.com/sas/cars.sas7bdat", 
    NULL)
```

This is my data wrtan and data viz


```{r}

library(tidyverse)


cars %>%
 filter(MPG >= 13L & MPG <= 47L) %>%
 filter(CYL >= 4L & CYL <= 8L) %>%
 filter(ENG >= 
    95L & ENG <= 455L) %>%
 filter(WGT >= 2109L & WGT <= 5140L) %>%
 ggplot() +
 aes(x = MPG, y = CYL) +
 geom_point(size = 1L, colour = "#0c4c8a") +
 theme_minimal()
